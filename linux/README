Make sure you have Vagrant installed on your PC.

In the top level folder there is a file call Vagrantfile.

To run this type:

 vagrant up


This will run a new virtual linux instance on your computer, which will then procede to do the following things.

1. Install mysql-server
2. Create a database called forest
3. Create a table with 1 table called version that hold the db verions in a column called version (Initially set to version 2)
4. Run the required upgrade scripts from the upgrade directory.

You can also login to the vagrant instance by :

  vagrant ssh

The bash scripts are in "sql-scripts" directory.
The sql upgrade scripts are avaialable in "sql-scripts/upgrades"

The above scripts are on the vagrant box under /vagrant/sql-scripts
